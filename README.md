Quick Oscillation Analysis

---

Primary goal is to build a framework that can define a quick oscillation analysis with a few modifications of text file.
Once the analysis is defined, programs are defined to calculate useful information such as senstivities, bias studies.

Dependent on ROOT and Prob3++ packages.

The package will unlikely be useful to anyone but myself. I envision that this will serve merely to teach me git and an exercise in writing packages for distribution rather than a one-and-done calculation.
