# qosc: Quick Oscillation Analysis

Primary goal is to build a framework that can define a quick oscillation analysis with a few modifications of text file.
Once the analysis is defined, programs are defined to calculate useful information such as senstivities, bias studies.

The package will unlikely be useful to anyone but myself. I envision that this will serve merely to teach me git and an exercise in writing packages for distribution rather than a one-and-done calculation.
